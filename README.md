### Project Overview

I created a python script that allows you to convert a csv file into a SQL table. Users must allow enter the name of the csv file and create a table name in order to successfully create the table.

### Limitations

The only file format accepted is a csv file. 

### Use Case

For continous data analysis and engineering on a dataset.
